# Introduction

A seed project for Angular 2 apps using Redux. Derived from [mgechev/angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) plus [wbuchwalter/ng2-redux](https://github.com/wbuchwalter/ng2-redux).

# How to start

**Note** that this seed project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7.

You must have `ts-node` installed as global. If you don't, use:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

In order to start using seed:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/archfirst/angular2-seed-redux.git
cd angular2-seed-redux
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
npm run docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod
```

# Configuration

Default application server configuration

```javascript
var PORT             = 5555;
var LIVE_RELOAD_PORT = 4002;
var DOCS_PORT        = 4003;
var APP_BASE         = '/';
```

Configure at runtime

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080 --reload-port 4000 --base /my-app/
```

# Running tests

```bash
npm test

# Debug - In two different shell windows
npm run build.test.watch      # 1st window
npm run karma.start           # 2nd window

# code coverage (istanbul)
# auto-generated at the end of `npm test`
# view coverage report:
npm run serve.coverage

# e2e (aka. end-to-end, integration) - In three different shell windows
# Make sure you don't have a global instance of Protractor

# npm run webdriver-update <- You will need to run this the first time
npm run webdriver-start
npm run serve.e2e
npm run e2e

# e2e live mode - Protractor interactive mode
# Instead of last command above, you can use:
npm run e2e.live
```
